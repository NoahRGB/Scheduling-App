# Scheduling App
A React app that makes fetch requests to a backend API that contacts a local PostgreSQL database to display a users events for this month

The UI is not finalised currently, but the main functionality is in place where a user can create an account / login to their account and add activities. The month will then be displayed with all of the user's activities displayed under the correct day.
